To ensure this quality of advice, Nosvinsdumonde provides all its wine merchants with a complete training course lasting 5 weeks. Thanks to the integrated Nosvinsdumonde School (approved training centre), each future wine merchant not only discovers the products but also learns about advice and optimal management of a store.</p><p class="text-white">At Nosvinsdumonde, all questions are answered, whether about the wine, its service or the art of harmonizing it with the dishes! And who better placed than your wine merchant to deliver simple, clear and positive messages in terms of good consumer practices?</p><h3 class="mt-5 mb-5 text-white text-center">STRONG CULTURE OF INNOVATION</h3><p class="text-white">First to sell bottled wine, Nosvinsdumonde has always been able to assert itself as a pioneer by creating an ever more innovative range of services: home delivery in 1840, the availability of chilled wines in 1988, the ice cube service in 2012…</p><p class="text-white">And since innovation also involves the offer, Nosvinsdumonde was the first to offer Beaujolais Nouveau on a large scale in 1966. In 1995, it honored Vins de Pays de France with the Petites Récoltes range, followed by Grains de Cépage in 2003.</p><div class="mt-5 mb-5 mobile text-white text-center"><div><h4>TRIBULATIONS OF NECTAR</h4></div><div class="row text-start" style="align-items: center;"><div class="col-md-8"><p>The notoriety of Nosvinsdumonde was affirmed thanks to intense advertising, both in the cinema (first advertising cartoons in 1921), and on the walls with the appearance of Nectar in 1922. Born from the pencil of Dransy and inspired of a house delivery man named Le Paven, the frail mustachioed delivery man with saucer eyes, loaded with bottles in each hand, who enjoyed immediate and undisputed popular success.</p><p>In 2012, on the occasion of the 190th anniversary of Nosvinsdumonde, the emblematic delivery man of the house was modernized and made us discover a new face.</p><p><b>Today, the wine merchant is in the spotlight of the advertising communication of Nosvinsdumonde.</b></p></div><div class="col-md-4 mt-5 mb-5 item_img"><img style="max-width: 400px;width: 100%;" src="https://nosvinsdumonde.com/assets/img/bouteille-blanc-vermentino-decor.png" alt=""></div></div></div></div>',
